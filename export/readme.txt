you actually want to (try to) use this peace of shit?

well i cant upload files bigger than 25MB so heres a link to it...
oh and its like a version thingy so you need to make a new folder in... heres what it should look like:

Roaming\.minecraft
├── versions
│   ├── 1.8.8
│   └── test
│       ├── test.jar
│       └── test.json

!!! THE FOLDER HAS THE HAVE THE SAME NAME AS .json AND .jar FILE !!!
just create a new minecraft version thingy in the launcher and select "tutorial" as the version and it should work

oh yea heres the link:             https://anonfiles.com/Lef9Y8Wdx3/test_jar
and the json file should be here:  https://anonfiles.com/f0eaY3W0xb/test_json
